# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-App
üéØ Project Objective This project aims to detect the presence of Parkinson's Disease using voice measurements and a Naive Bayes Machine Learning model. The project includes a fully interactive Streamlit web app to make predictions and explore the disease's indicators.

üîç Dataset Overview
The model was trained on the Parkinson's Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains voice measurements from both healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's.
